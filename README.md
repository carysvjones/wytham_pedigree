To use this repository:
Navigate to the folder where you want to install the repository. Then type git clone https://github.com/jonesc176/wytham_pedigree.git
Or just download as .zip file.

Open the wytham_pedigree.Rproj file. 

First open and run pre_prep_data.R - will output clean data files that are needed to run the next script
you only have to run this once to create the datasets you need to make the pedigree (I just included it here for transparency so you can see what I did to the data)

Then open and run 1_Prep_data.Rmd - will give you the pedigree

Examples of animal models in Asreml-R are in 2_Run_models.Rmd
